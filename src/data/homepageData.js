  "Most, if not all of the paintings displayed here were painted from life in Florence, Italy. As a classically trained painter, I have dedicated my practice to capturing the essence of my subjects with precision and vividness. My education in the rich artistic environment of Florence has deeply influenced my approach, emphasizing accuracy in tone and color. Each portrait I create embodies an air of serenity and quiet contemplation, inviting viewers to experience the stillness and depth of the moment. Through my work, I strive to convey not only the physical likeness but also the inner life of my subjects, bringing timeless beauty to the canvas. ",
